1. Drawing the Free-body diagram of the figure, and seeing all the forces at work.
2. All the forces at work becomes your $\vec{f}$ vector.
3. Everything boils down to the spring equation, $\vec{f} = k \Delta x$
4. Write a function to generate a stiffness matrix for each element of your figure, taking in its Young's Modulus (E), Area (A) and the length of the element (l) to form a stiffness constant k, where $k = \frac{EA}{l}$
	1. This matrix is formed by certain equations, the $\Delta x$ becomes the difference in displacement of 
5. 

%I need to find out what the area meant and how the final matrix equations came about to describe the force, I should recheck that bit.%
