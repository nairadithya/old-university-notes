  abstract = {Computer models in medical diagnosis are being developed to help physicians differentiate between healthy patients and patients with disease. These models can aid in successful decision making by allowing calculation of disease likelihood on the basis of known patient characteristics and clinical test results. Two of the most frequently used computer models in clinical risk estimation are logistic regression and an artificial neural network. A study was conducted to review and compare these two models, elucidate the advantages and disadvantages of each, and provide criteria for model selection. The two models were used for estimation of breast cancer risk on the basis of mammographic descriptors and demographic risk factors. Although they demonstrated similar performance, the two models have unique characteristics---strengths as well as limitations---that must be considered and may prove complementary in contributing to improved clinical decision making.},

  abstract = {Meta-heuristic optimization algorithms have been used to solve mathematically unidentifiable problems. The main purpose of the optimization methods on problem-solving is to choose the best solution in predefined conditions. To increase performance of the optimization methods, chaotic maps for instance Logistic, Singer, Sine, Tent, Chebyshev, Circle have been widely used in the literature. However, hybrid 1D chaotic maps have higher performance than the 1D chaotic maps. The hybrid chaotic maps have not been used in the optimization process. In this article, 1D hybrid chaotic map (logistic-sine map)-based novel swarm optimization method is proposed to achieve higher numerical results than other optimization methods. Logistic-sine map has good statistical result, and this advantage is used directly to calculate global optimum value in this study. The proposed algorithm is a swarm-based optimization algorithm, and the seed value of the logistic-sine map is generated from local best solutions to reach global optimum. In order to test the proposed hybrid chaotic map-based optimization method, widely used numerical benchmark functions are chosen. The proposed chaotic optimization method is also tested on compression spring design problem. Results and comparisons clearly show that the proposed chaotic optimization method is successful.},

The process of automation is likely to improve the efficiency of the detection process, and it may also provide higher detection accuracy by removing the internal subjective human factors in the process. Starting from the measurement data of biopsy cells in women with abnormal breast masses, logistic regression algorithm is applied to study the efficiency of machine learning for cancer detection. In this paper, the LogisticRegression algorithm of Sklearn machine learning library is used to classify the data sets of breast cancer (diagnosis). The classification results show that when the two features of maximum texture and maximum perimeter are selected, the classification accuracy is 96.5\%, which is improved compared with the previous methods.},

  abstract = {Optimization is an imperative feature in almost all fields of Engineering, Economics, and Sciences. Due to the advent of high-end computers and the gradual increase in the complexity of optimization problems, algorithms for numerical optimization have been developed. Numerous existing numerical optimization algorithms suffer from premature convergence, poor local/global search abilities, and high computational complexity. A chaotic optimization algorithm and a chaotic map could help overcome most of these setbacks. This paper offers a detailed study and analysis of five chaotic maps used for global Optimization, namely Chebyshev, Cubic, ICMIC, Neuron, and Sine maps. This work also proposes a pioneering global optimization method, Hybrid Chaotic Pattern Search Algorithm (HCPSA), for finding the global minimum for multivariable unconstrained optimization problems. Numerical results over 12 benchmark functions and comparative results (comparison of accuracy and computational time) with some popular algorithms evidence the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm for higher dimensional non-linear functions. The efficient usage of chaotic maps has helped reduce the computational time to evaluate the optimum for higher dimensional non-linear functions. To showcase the use of HCPSA in a real-world problem, we have taken the problem of analyzing financial ratios for predicting bankruptcy. Banks predict bankruptcy from the start of their businesses to determine their financial stability. In this work, we initially perform Logistic Regression (LR) on the data obtained from the banks to get the reliability function with financial ratios as decision variables. After this, the function is maximized using HCPSA and a Chebyshev map. This methodology is beneficial for decision-makers within a bank to maximize the reliability of the financial ratios and, most essential, to protect the bank from disasters. Comparative results of reliability prediction using HCPSA and PSO and a non-parametric statistical test proves that the proposed algorithm is better in terms of accuracy.},

  abstract = {Chaos optimization algorithms as a novel method of global optimization have attracted much attention, which were all based on Logistic map. However, we have noticed that the probability density function of the chaotic sequences derived from Logistic map is a Chebyshev-type one, which may affect the global searching capacity and computational efficiency of chaos optimization algorithms considerably. Considering the statistical property of the chaotic sequences of Logistic map and Kent map, the improved hybrid chaos-BFGS optimization algorithm and the Kent map based hybrid chaos-BFGS algorithm are proposed. Five typical nonlinear functions with multimodal characteristic are tested to compare the performance of five hybrid optimization algorithms, which are the conventional Logistic map based chaos-BFGS algorithm, improved Logistic map based chaos-BFGS algorithm, Kent map based chaos-BFGS algorithm, Monte Carlo-BFGS algorithm, mesh-BFGS algorithm. The computational performance of the five algorithms is compared, and the numerical results make us question the high efficiency of the chaos optimization algorithms claimed in some references. It is concluded that the efficiency of the hybrid optimization algorithms is influenced by the statistical property of chaotic/stochastic sequences generated from chaotic/stochastic algorithms, and the location of the global optimum of nonlinear functions. In addition, it is inappropriate to advocate the high efficiency of the global optimization algorithms only depending on several numerical examples of low-dimensional functions.}

  abstract = {In microarray-based cancer classification and prediction, gene selection is an important research problem owing to the large number of genes and the small number of experimental conditions. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian approach to gene selection and classification using the logistic regression model. The basic idea of our approach is in conjunction with a logistic regression model to relate the gene expression with the class labels. We use Gibbs sampling and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods to discover important genes. To implement Gibbs Sampler and MCMC search, we derive a posterior distribution of selected genes given the observed data. After the important genes are identified, the same logistic regression model is then used for cancer classification and prediction. Issues for efficient implementation for the proposed method are discussed. The proposed method is evaluated against several large microarray data sets, including hereditary breast cancer, small round blue-cell tumors, and acute leukemia. The results show that the method can effectively identify important genes consistent with the known biological findings while the accuracy of the classification is also high. Finally, the robustness and sensitivity properties of the proposed method are also investigated.},
