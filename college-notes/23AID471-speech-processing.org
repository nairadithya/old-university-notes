* Syllabus
** Unit 1
Introduction to Speech Processing, Overview of the human speech production system, acoustic and physiological mechanisms of speech production, glottal signal characteristics and source features, significance of glottal activity regions, speech signal characteristics, acoustic/articulatory characteristics of different speech sounds -vowels and consonants.
** Unit 2
Short time processing of speech for estimation of excitation and vocal tract features - Time Domain processing- Energy, magnitude, zero crossing rate, STACF, Linear Prediction Analysis, Frequency domain processing and Spectro-temporal representation of speech signal- Narrowband, wideband spectrograms, Cepstral Analysis, Melspectrogram, MFCC feature extraction.
** Unit 3
Speech data preparation and feature engineering, machine learning versus deep learning models in speech classification tasks (age, gender, dialect/accent), Automatic speech recognition (ASR) - statistical models- Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) for ASR, Deep learning speech recognition pipeline (end-to-end models), overview of other speech technology applications such as emotion recognition, speaker recognition, speech synthesis, and speech pathology detection.
