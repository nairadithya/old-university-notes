# Double Slit Experiment

$P(z) = \frac{\text{how many electrons received}}{\text{No. of electrons shot}}$
Somehow, the electron gun manages to convey properties that are both as a particle and a wave.

Young did this experiment for light in the early 1900s.

At that time, Newton's theory that light was a particle was predominant at the time.

Young disproved that. He did not get the recognition he deserved. Because he said Newton is wrong. He was shunned by the scientific community at the time. 
Back to the experiment,

Take A1 and A2 to be the slits, and a mark is made when A1 and A2 has an electron pass through them, and now a light source is kept on the centre of the screen and it glows every time an electron passes through the slit.

| $A_1$ | $A_2$ |
| ---- | ---- |
| 1 | 0 |
| 0 | 1 |
| $\cdots$ | $\cdots$ |
| $P_1 (z)$ | $P_2(z)$ |
The summations of $P_1(z)$ and $P_2(z)$ is $P_{12}(z)$ and the crazy part is that the graph to be found is now like a particle.

It seems that the light source is affecting the way the graph looks.

Let's try lowering the energy of the light source. 

$E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}$

These two are very separate experiments.
1. $E \rightarrow S_1 \rightarrow S_2$
2. $E \rightarrow S_1 \rightarrow A_1/A_2 \rightarrow S_2$

Somehow the measurement of the state, changes the state of the system.
$State \leftarrow \text{measurement(which operates on the state)} \rightarrow \text{outcome of a measurement}$

We learnt in Mathematics that given a set, with certain operations for addition and multiplication is termed a vector space. Together with another additional operation known as the "inner product" would be called an **inner product space.**
We're looking at such a space known as the **Hilbert Space**
