# Recap Of Previous Lecture
[[Lecture 1]]
- Bullets were shot to two screens, one screen with two slits.
- A detector is placed on the second screen.
- An analysis of the two screens, and the probabilty of the detector detecting a bullet in a given point on the second screen is performed.
- Another assumption is that the bullets are **indestructible.**
- $$P(z) = \frac{\text{no. at z}}{\text{total no. of bullets}}$$
- When one of the slits are closed, it forms a wave, which has a local maxima at the slit which is not closed.
- When both slits are open, the maxima is at the centre of the second screen because the probability of both slits allowing the bullet to enter is twice when either one of those slits are closed. 
- $$P_1{z} + P_2{z} = P_{12}z$$

Repeating the same experiment, but with waves.
- A tank of water is used, with two screens. 
- A disturbance is created, in a cylindrical form at some distance from the first screen.
- These waves hit each slit, then creating their own sources of disturbance. 
- We want to measure the intensity of these disturbances.
- $Intensity \propto Amplitude$
- $P(z) \propto (h-h_0)$
- When one slit is closed, the graph of P(z) to height  is similar to the first setup with bullets.
- Someething to note is, that the units of measurement for these two setups so far are that they are different.
- When both slits are open, the graph of the P(z) to the y-axis is an oscillating graph that gradually increases until the point of intersection of the two slits on the second screen near the centre.

Repeating the same experiment,
- Replace the gun with an electron gun, which shoots electrons at a constant energy.
- It is assumed that the electrons will not pass through screen 1, unless it's through the two slits.
- The detector beeps when an electron hits it.
- $$P(z) = \frac{\text{no. of beeps at z}}{\text{Total no. of beeps}} $$
- When one slit is closed, the graph is the same as that of the bullets
- When both slits are open.
	- The same graph as the wave graph was obtained.
- Place a light source that glows directionally, in the direction in which the electron is coming from or which respective slit.
- Add up the
