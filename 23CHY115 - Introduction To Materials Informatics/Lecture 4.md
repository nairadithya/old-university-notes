**To recap,**
We were looking at the double slit experiment. That's a peek into quantum mechanics and the fact that measurement of state changes the state of the experiment.

We're trying to get from 

$$
\text{quantum mechanics} \rightarrow \text{bonding}, \text{And using } \text{structure of materials} \rightarrow \text{properties}
$$
These same ideas will be covered in Quantum Computing.

#### The Components 
- State of the system,
- Measurement of the state of the system $\rightarrow$ Operator
- Outcome of the measurement $\rightarrow$ Inner product e.g. dot product.
# Notation
- State - $\ket{A}$ 
	- Encodes all the information about the particle
- Measurement Operator - $\hat{A}$

Going back to our familiar world (3-dimensional space.)

Taking an example, a 2d plane.

Some vector $\underline{v} = v_1 \hat{e_1} + v_2 \hat{e_2}$, where $\hat{e_1} \perp \hat{e_2}$

Take another orthogonal basis $\hat{e_1}'$ and $\hat{e_2}'$

Then, $\underline{v} = v_1' \hat{e_1}' + v_2' \hat{e_2}'$

 In linear algebra,
 $A\vec{x} = b$

Consider a general vector $\vec{w}$

In which,

$A\vec{v} = \vec{w}$

The vector is going to be denoted as $\ket{v}$, and $\hat{O}$ as the operator.

$\hat{O}\ket{v} = \ket{w}$

To find how much of $\vec{v}$ is in $\vec{w}$, we take the projection of v onto w.

>[!faq] Notation
>This notation is known as "Paul Dirac" notation

$\ket{v} = v_1 \ket{\hat{e_1}}+ v_2 \ket{\hat{e_2}}$

For the notation, when $\bra{v}$ is written, the basis is transformed to its complex conjugate.

$\bra{v} = v_1^* \bra{e_1} + v_2^*\bra{e_2}$, where $v_1^*$ and $v_2^*$ is the corresponding complex conjugate

Performing the dot product is denoted by $\bra{v}\ket{w} = (v_1^*\bra{\hat{e_1}}+ v_2^*\bra{\hat{e_2}})(w_1 \ket{\hat{e_1}} + w_2 \ket{\hat{e_2}})$

$\bra{\hat{e_1}}\ket{\hat{e_2}}=0$, $\bra{\hat{e_1}}\ket{\hat{e_2}}=1$

$v_1^*w_1 + v_2^*w_2$

Coming back to the core of what we're trying to solve, about state and measurement.

$$\hat{O}\vec{v} = \vec{w}$$

We learned earlier this semester that there are some vectors, that transformations do not affect. [[Class Notes.pdf]](Eigenvectors and eigenvalues.)

Take two such vectors $v_1$ and $v_2$,

$\hat{O}\vec{v_1} = \lambda_1 \vec{v_1}$ 
$\hat{O}\vec{v_2} = \lambda_1 \vec{v_2}$

$\hat{O}\ket{v_1} = \lambda_1 \ket{v_1}$
$\hat{O}\ket{v_2} = \lambda_2\ket{v_2}$

$\ket{v} = v_1' \ket{v^{(1)}}+v_2' \ket{v^{(2)}}$
Reminder, this is the equation we're working in.
$\hat{O}\ket{v}=\ket{w}$

Recall the double slit  experiment,
![[Drawing 2024-02-16 14.36.14.excalidraw]]

Going back to the electron gun experiment
The two slits $A_1$ and $A_2$ are denoted by $\ket{A_1}$ and $\ket{A_2}$,

Under the conjecture that the electrons are waves, 

The state of the entire system would be,
$\ket{A_1}$ + $\ket{A_2}$ , before measurement

There are **two** measurements in the experiment, once with the light source and then with the detector.

Let's take the measurement to be $\hat{A}$, which includes both the light source and the detector that beeps.

$\hat{A}(\ket{A_1} + \ket{A_2}) = \{\ket{A_1}, \ket{A_2}\}$

It becomes a bit apparent that $\ket{A_1}$and $\ket{A_2}$ are eigenvectors.

Taking the vector $\ket{\alpha}$

$\ket{\alpha} = \ket{A_1}+\ket{A_2}$

>The state of a system is analogous to the eigenvectors of the operator.

Then,

$\hat{A}\ket{\alpha} = \{\ket{A_1}, \ket{A_2}\}$

$\hat{A}(\ket{A_1} + \ket{A_2}) = \hat{A}\ket{A_1} + \hat{A} \ket{A_2}\}$
$=a_1 \ket{A_1} + a_2 \ket{A_2}$

Remember that,
$\ket{\alpha} = \ket{A_1} + \ket{A_2}$
$\bra{\alpha} = \bra{A_1}+\bra{A_2}$

$\braket{\alpha|A|\alpha}$
